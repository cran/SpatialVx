Description: Spatial forecast verification refers to verifying weather forecasts when the verification set (forecast and observations) is on a spatial field, usually a high-resolution gridded spatial field.  Most of the functions here require the forecast and observed fields to be gridded and on the same grid.  For a thorough review of most of the methods in this package, please see Gilleland et al. (2009) <doi: 10.1175/2009WAF2222269.1>.
